      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our services may contain links to other websites, applications, and
        online services. If you choose to visit a third party service or click
        on another third party link, you will be directed to that third
        party&apos;s website, application, or online service. The fact that we
        link to a website, content is not an endorsement, authorization or
        representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
        endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or
        practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or
        services.
      </p>

      <h2>Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we are
        advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these
        third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include
        their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain
        options.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser
        options. To know more detailed information about cookie management with
        specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers&apos; respective
        websites.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your browser.
        They serve various purposes, such as remembering your preferences,
        enhancing user experience, and facilitating authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
        At our site, we utilize third-party authentication services, including
        Google OAuth, to secure and streamline the login process. When you log
        in using Google OAuth, a cookie is generated and stored on your device.
        This cookie is essential for the proper functioning of our
        authentication system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Google OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us
        recognize your authenticated session. It enables you to access our
        application seamlessly without the need to re-enter your credentials
        repeatedly during a single session.
      </p>

      <p>
        It&apos;s important to note that these cookies do not store personal
        information directly on our servers. Instead, they serve as tokens that
        establish a secure connection between your browser and the
        authentication provider, in this case, Google. This enhances the
        security of the authentication process while providing a more
        user-friendly experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using our site and opting for third-party authentication, you consent
        to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can manage your
        cookie preferences through your browser settings.
      </p>
